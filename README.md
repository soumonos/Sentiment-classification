# Sentiment-classification
- Projects on Sentiment classification.
- Requirements:
Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras tensorflow api and keras backend

- The classification.ipynb file holds the sentiment classification model on collected tweets. the tp_sentiment_analysis.tar file consists 
of a pretrained word embedding model. the preprocess_twitter.py is for preprocessing the tweets and the embedding1.py is used to load the word
embedding for training our classifiers. We have used CNN and RNN with GRU as the supervised classifiers.
